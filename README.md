# Intro to Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project

Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program. Developed code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow [Jupyter Notebook: Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/montsebenito/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/main/Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb), and a command line application [Jupyter Text Editor: predict.py](https://github.com/montsebenito/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/main/predict.py).

GPU's has been enabled to complete this project.

### Data

The dataset used is [Oxford Flowers 102](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102) and it includes 102 different types of flowers, with ~20 images per flower to train on.
