# Intro to Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project

Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program. Developed code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow [https://github.com/montsebenito/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/main/Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb], and a command line application [https://github.com/montsebenito/Flower_Image_Classifier/blob/main/predict.py].

GPU's has been enabled to complete this project.

### Data

The dataset [https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102] includes 102 different types of flowers, with ~20 images per flower to train on.
